In this repository, I will be documenting key points from my reading of "C++ Primer" as I often find myself forgetting certain details over time.

+ The version I am reading is in Chinese, so the notes will be written in both Chinese and English for convenience. If you have any questions or would like to see a full English version, please don't hesitate to contact me.
+ I also welcome contributions from other C++ veterans, enthusiasts, and beginners to help improve this repository! If you come across any errors or would like to contribute, please feel free to contact me via my [personal email](guozebin2012@163.com).

## Updating!
